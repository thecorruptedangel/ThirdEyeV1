# ThirdEyeV1
ThirdEye is an innovative solution designed to assist visually impaired individuals through LLM-based vision-to-audio smart glasses. These glasses offer capabilities similar to high-end products like Meta Glasses but are developed at a fraction of the cost. This version is based on Moondream LLM running locally.
